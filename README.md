👋 Hi, I’m @4neta, I came to UK in 2020 and I'm currently living & working in Cambridge as a C software developer.  
👀 I’m interested in many things, inluding photography, table tennis, psychology... And of course computer science!  
🌱 I’m currently learning Java.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people without big experience, just to learn together!  
📫 How to reach me... just DM :)
